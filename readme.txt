= Usage =
Install the 'Add File Version (AFV)' plugin and activate it. Upon activation, AFV by default will add version in AUTO mode to ALL CSS and JS files added using wp_enqueue_style and wp_enqueue_script, admin_enqueue_style and admin_enqueue_script. The plugin provides a page where you can change and alter its settings. It can be found at the WordPress dashboard > Tools > Add File Version. 

There are 2 modes available, AUTO and MANUAL. The AUTO mode adds file version based on PHP file modification time, while the MANUAL mode adds version based on your input to the target files (CSS/JS). Each versioning mode allows you to select files to add version. It can be ALL, CSS only or JS only. To disable the versioning function of the plugin, just uncheck both modes and save the changes by clicking the button at the bottom.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the purpose of the plugin? =
The plugin can be utilized to flush the CSS/JS files, whenever there are file changes or modifications (AUTO mode version is based on file modification time, while manual depends on your version input). It is very useful during development and even live scenarios, as it can facilitate in making the changes visible and force it to take effect. 

Important Note: If there is an active file cache plugin, this tool may not work as the cache plugin interferes/manage the handling of file caching of WordPress.
